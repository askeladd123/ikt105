## Console application in C#

The application reads and runs three scripts, while giving feedback to the console.

You can find the Microsoft Visual Studio project "CoVidRental" inside the "Visual Studio" folder in our project root folder. 
To build the project you need to install "MySql.Data" library, and change working directory to our project root folder. Then you will need to set up a database, using the SQL-code in the file "database_setup.txt". 

The code need you to specify connection, then it will automatically run the three scipts, outputting data to the console. Note: a INSERT can give a "query failed" message if row already exists. This doesn't mean the code is broken!
